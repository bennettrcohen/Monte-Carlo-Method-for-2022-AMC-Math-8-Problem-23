# Monte-Carlo-Method-for-2022-AMC-Math-8-Problem-23

After tutoring a student to help them prepare for the AMC Math 8 exam, I returned to one of the problems we went over. The theoretical solution was quite cumbersome, and I found the problem better lent itself to a computatioal solution through the use of Monte Carlo simulation.
