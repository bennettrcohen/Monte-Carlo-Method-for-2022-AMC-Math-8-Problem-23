# Monte-Carlo-Method-for-2022-AMC-Math-8-Problem-23

After tutoring a student to help them prepare for the AMC Math 8 exam, I later returned to one of the problems we went over. The theoretical solution was quite cumbersome--and while it would be of no use on the actual pen-and-paper exam--I replicated the correct answer more simply using Monte Carlo simulation.
